# Modeling-Nature-Branches
In this repository I will collect Pov-Ray scripts for modeling various types of branched systems.

I start by dichotomously branched systems modeled in a step-wise process, layer by layer. For each layer the end points of the elements are stored and used as 
starting positions of new elements in the next layer.

Modifying parameters in this process will result in pretty different structures. 
Here a structure of high variability: 
![02Dichotomous](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c276a8f6-9dc8-437c-94a6-38e807d0e354)
In the following structure elements from subsequent layers are strongly decreasing in size.

And here the angles used are decreasing in size:

Here comes a structure where branched and non-branched elements are applied randomly resulting in a relatively natural branched system:

My emphasis in dichotomously branched structures comes from my long-term research topic "arbuscular mycorrhiza", which is an interaction between the roots or many 
different plants and a small group of fungi. The exchange of nutrients (plant carbohydrates vs fungal mineral nutrients) is an important driver of this interaction 
and this dichotomously branched fungal hyphae (called arbuscules) within individual root cells is the place for this exchange. (Providing a large interface between plant
and fungal cells.)

These two images show the arrangement of fungal arbuscules within plant roots.

Apart from this step-like process, layer by layer, there is still another approach, which came to my mind when looking at main root systems. Have a look at the following two examples. 
Here I first modeled the main root (red colour), then the laterals of first order (blue colour) and finally the laterals of second order (orange colour).

![10RootSystem2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bc808fd-8d3d-4428-aac1-241a4e598c8a)
Here are a few examples modeled using this approach:
